# cpp-battleship
Battleship game built in CPP for practicing CPP syntax and fundamentals. Main things to practice were:

1. reference/pointer based data manipulation,
2. getting familiarized with classes in CPP
3. tried my best to oop this but clearly not perfect

Didn't wanna spend too long on this as I have a ton of material to go through. But if you have any tips on low-hanging efficiency wins, or suggestions for better code organization please fire away!
Criticize me as much as you want as I'm trying to get better at CPP.

I spedrun through the game demo due to size limitations of the video - hopefully you can catch the main features
